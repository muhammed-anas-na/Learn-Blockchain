# Learn Blockchain with me üòâ
### (Let's start from the basic concepts of blockchain and move forward)


#### The world is expericing an undergoing digital transormation, it's the blockchain transformation.

    <strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:</strong> You will get a job after learning Blockchain.

<p>Let's be practical. Everything has a initial learning curve to overcome. I believe that you have some sort of idea about technology. Nooo, i don't mean that you should be a Larry page. Just someone who have worked on a project,that's enought.</p>

<h2>What is blockchain? ‚õì</h2>
<p>Blockchain is like a digital notebook that can't be changed, and it's shared by everyone in a group. It helps people keep track of things, like money or valuable items(houses,car,land), and records every time something is bought, sold, or transferred in a way that everyone can see and agree on. Since it's shared, no one can cheat or change the information once it's written down. <strong>If don't understand, read it again.</strong></p>

<h3>Then what is blockchain network?</h3>
<p>Yes, it's a network of this digital notebooks. Each notebook is called as a <strong>nodes</strong>. Each node in the network has a copy of the blockchain, and they communicate with each other to ensure that the information (like transactions or asset transfers) is accurate and consistent across all copies. When someone wants to add a new information in the blockchain, the nodes in the network checks and confirms everything in the network is correct. Once they agreed, the information is added and everyone's copy get updated.</p>

## Nodes
<p>Blockchains consist of a group of computers known as nodes. These nodes work together to synchronize the blockchain‚Äôs data, handle transaction requests, and reach consensus on the validity of those transactions.</p>

#### Full Node
<p>It is a type of computer which stotes the entire blockchain. Including all transcation history from the beginning. It also validates every block that is being added to the blockchain network.</p>

#### Light Node
<p>A light node only downloads a small portion of the blockchain data, usually just the headers of the blocks. It relies on full nodes to provide detailed information when needed.</p>

#### Mining Node
<p>It is a computer that solves a complex mathmatical problem(proof of work) to add new blocks to the blockchain. Once the mining nodes craete a block it is validated by other nodes. The miner will be rewarded by cryptocurrenty for their work. Minining computer needs high specifications and high electricity supply.</p>

## What is a Block> ‚óª
<p>When each transaction taking place, it is documented and stroed as a data block. When miners add new blocks which also store another transaction data, it forms a chain. Blocks are attanged in a specific order. New blocks are added one after the other(Like a linked list). Each hash includes a unique key called <strong>hash</strong>. It is like a pointer to the previous node. The very first block is the genesis block. Unlike other blocks, it doesn‚Äôt have a reference to a previous block because it marks the beginning of the chain.
