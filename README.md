<h2>What is blockchain? ‚õì</h2>
<p>Blockchain is like a digital notebook that can't be changed, and it's shared by everyone in a group. It helps people keep track of things, like money or valuable items, and records every time something is bought, sold, or transferred in a way that everyone can see and agree on. Since it's shared, no one can cheat or change the information once it's written down.</p>
