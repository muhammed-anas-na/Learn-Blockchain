<p>Let's be practical. Everything has a initial learning curve to overcome. I believe that you have some sort of idea about technology. Nooo, i don't mean that you should be a Larry page. Just someone who have worked on a project,that's enought.</p>

<h2>What is blockchain? ‚õì</h2>
<p>Blockchain is like a digital notebook that can't be changed, and it's shared by everyone in a group. It helps people keep track of things, like money or valuable items(houses,car,land), and records every time something is bought, sold, or transferred in a way that everyone can see and agree on. Since it's shared, no one can cheat or change the information once it's written down. <strong>If don't understand, read it again.</strong></p>

<h3>Then what is blockchain network?</h3>
<p>Yes, it's a network of this digital notebooks. Each notebook is called as a <strong>nodes</strong>.Each node in the network has a copy of the blockchain, and they communicate with each other to ensure that the information (like transactions or asset transfers) is accurate and consistent across all copies. When someone wants to add a new information in the blockchain, the nodes in the network checks and confirms everything in the network is correct. Once they agreed, the information is added and everyone's copy get updated.</p>
